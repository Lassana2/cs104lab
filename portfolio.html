<h3>College: NJIT. UCID: ls465. Degree Program: Architecture </h3>
<p>Lassana Sylla is my name. I am a transfer student 
    <br>from Mercer County Community College. I am currently 
    <br>pursuing my degree in architecture here at NJIT. 
    <br>I have always been passionate about design and 
    <br>creating innovative spaces that inspire and captivate 
    <br>people. Being a transfer student will allow me to bring 
    <br>a unique perspective to my studies, combining the knowledge 
    <br>and experiences gained from both institutions.</p>
